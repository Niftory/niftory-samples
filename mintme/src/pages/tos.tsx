            Registered Accounts (as defined below) may participate in a Transaction in three ways:
            (a) by purchasing Digital Collectibles from NextName (each, a &ldquo;Drop&rdquo;) on a
            Hosting Service; (b) by purchasing Digital Collectibles from other users or Collectors
            on the Site&rsquo;s marketplace; or (c) by bidding on a onetime Drop auction (each, a
            &ldquo;Auction Drop&rdquo;) on a Hosting Service. There are different types of Drops
            available for purchase on the Site, and we reserve the right to modify the types, prices
            and numbers of Drops available at our discretion. We strongly encourage you not to
            purchase Digital Collectibles other than in Drops on the Site&rsquo;s marketplace. If
            you decide to purchase Digital Collectibles in any other way, you understand that such
            purchases will be entirely at your sole risk. We currently use Stripe&trade; as our
            third party service provider for payment services (&ldquo;Stripe&rdquo;), and by using
            our Services you agree to be bound by Stripe&rsquo;s Services Agreement, available at{" "}

            All payments or financial transactions that you engage in via the Site will be conducted
            through either the Flow Network or Stripe. We have no control over these payments or
            transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We do
            not provide refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the Site &ndash;
            whether for Digital Collectibles, Drops, Auction Drops or anything else. All information
            that you provide us, the Flow Network, Stripe or any third party payment service
            provider in connection with a purchase, Transaction or other monetary transaction
            interaction with or through our Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You

            effect when such charges are incurred. You must provide us with a current, valid,
            accepted Payment Method. Before engaging in a Transaction or putting up your unique
            digital asset for showcasing, or putting in any offer to purchase a unique Digital
            Collectible from another user, we may ask you to download a supported electronic wallet
            extension, and connect and unlock your digital wallets with that extension. Once you
            submit an order to sell or purchase a Digital Collectible, your order is passed on to
            the applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf. All
            transactions initiated through our site are facilitated and run by third-party
            electronic wallet extensions, and by using our services you agree that you are governed
            by the terms of service and privacy policy for the applicable extensions. We facilitate

            To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree that in no event will NextName or its
            affiliates be liable to you or any third party for any lost profit or any indirect,
            consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising from these
            terms or the services, products or third-party sites and products, or for any damages
            related to loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of business or anticipated savings,
            loss of use, loss of goodwill, loss of data, and whether caused by strict liability or
            tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or otherwise, even if foreseeable and

            claim, demand, or damages whatsoever resulting from or arising out of or in connection
            with these terms of the delivery, use, or performance of the service. Access to, and use
            of, the Site, products or third-party sites and products are at your own discretion and
            risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or

          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            You accept and acknowledge: The prices of blockchain assets (such as and Digital
            Collectibles) are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets
            could materially and adversely affect the Digital Collectibles, which may also be
            subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of
            Digital Collectibles will not lose money. You are solely responsible for determining
            what, if any, taxes apply to your Digital Collectibles transactions. NextName is not
            responsible for determining the taxes that apply to Digital Collectible Transaction or
            any Digital Collectible transaction. Our Service does not store, send, or receive
            Digital Collectibles. This is because Digital Collectibles exist only by virtue of the
            ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of Digital
            Collectibles occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on this Service. There are
            risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to,
            the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software
            introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
            information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that NextName will not
            be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or
            delays you may experience when using the Digital Collectibles, however caused. A lack of
            use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could
            negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and
            could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of Digital
            Collectibles. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies,
            and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect
            the development of the Transaction and/or Service and the utility of Digital
            Collectibles. The Service will rely on third-party platforms such as the Flow Network
            and Stripe to perform the Transactions and associated payments for Digital Collectibles.
            If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the
            terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or
            cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such
            platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged
            period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer. There are risks associated
            with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of
            purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata
            decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable.
            NextName reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any
            of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on
            NextName. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on NextName
            serve as grounds for a claim against NextName.

            This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim
            between you and NextName that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a)
            the Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement,
            interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Site,
            Services and Content including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications;
            (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Site or Services; or (d) any other aspect
            of your relationship or transactions with NextName, directly or indirectly, as a
            consumer (&ldquo;Dispute Claim&rdquo; or collectively, &ldquo;Dispute Claims&rdquo;).
            The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Dispute Claims that
            arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to the Agreement. You can reject
            and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement if within 30 days of accepting the Agreement
            by emailing NextName at legal@NextName.com with your first and last name and stating
            your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this
            Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of the Agreement, including the
            provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.
            For any Dispute Claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@NextName.com and attempt
            to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that NextName has not
            been able to resolve a Dispute Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any
            Dispute Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator
            (the &ldquo;Arbitrator&rdquo;), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA
            (the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict
            between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall
            control. AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available. The
            arbitration will be in Delaware, unless you and NextName agree otherwise. If you are
            using the Site for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any
            AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the
            award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable
            attorneys&rsquo; fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an
            individual using the Site for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a
            fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee
            waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of
            arbitration, your reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert
            and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent
            jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of
            your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on
            the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. You and NextName agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or
            local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating
            to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration
            Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is
            void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold
            arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision
            of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration,
            including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel. Nothing in this Section
            12 shall be deemed as: preventing NextName from seeking injunctive or other equitable
            relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
            misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or
            other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court,
            if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on
            only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. If this Arbitration Agreement
            is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void,
            unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance
            of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no
            impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in
            force, or the parties&rsquo; ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an
            individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful,
            in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief,
            then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be
            severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent
            jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration
            Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of
            any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed
            pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Class Action/Jury Trial
            Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE
            OBTAINED OR USED THE SITE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE
            BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&rsquo; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
            MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION
            OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND,
            UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
            PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS. YOU AND NEXTNAME AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY
            TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR
            INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER NEXTNAME USERS. YOU AND
            NEXTNAME FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, YOU AND NEXTNAME ARE EACH
            WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
            ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE
            PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.
